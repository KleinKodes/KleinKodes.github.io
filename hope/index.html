            <p>The media we consume daily has an impact on our thinking, behavior, and emotions. If you've fallen into a pattern of regularly watching or listening to the news, the majority of what you're consuming is likely about the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. And while staying up to date on local and national news, especially as it relates to mandates and health updates, is critical during this time, experts say over-consumption of the news can take a toll on your physical, emotional, and mental health.</p>
            <h1 id="what-it-does">What it does</h1>
            <p>The app first greets users with a screen prompting them to either sign up for an account or sign in to a pre-existing account. With the usual authentication formalities out of the way the app gets straight to business as our server scrapes oodles of articles from the internet and filters out the good from the bad, before displaying the user with a smorgasbord of good news.</p>
            <h1 id="how-we-built-it">How we built it</h1>
            <p>We have used flutter to create our android based application and used firebase as a database. ExpressJS as a backend web framework. With the help of RapidAPI, we are getting lists of top headline news.</p>
            <h1 id="challenges-we-ran-into">Challenges we ran into</h1>
            <p>Initially, we tried to include Google Cloud-Based Sentiment Analysis of each news. However, we thought to try some new technology. Since the majority of our team members were new to machine learning, we were facing too many challenges to even get started with. Issues with lack of examples available. So we again limited our app to show customized positive news. We wanted to add more features during the hacking period but due to time constraints, we had to limit.</p>
            <h1 id="accomplishments-that-we-re-proud-of">Accomplishments that we&#39;re proud of</h1>
            <p>Completely Working android based applications and integrated with backend having the contribution of each and every member of the team.</p>
            <h1 id="what-we-learned">What we learned</h1>
            <p>We have learned to fetch and upload data to firebase&#39;s real-time database through the flutter application. We learned the value of Team Contribution and Team Work which is the ultimate key to the success of the project.</p>
