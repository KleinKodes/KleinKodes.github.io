            <p>Take the initiative! Your health should, naturally, be your main priority. However, life&rsquo;s sporadic nature makes it nigh-impossible to keep track of everything. Between their
                jobs, exercise and calorie tracking, people simply do not have time to worry or think about how much water their bodies need. Let us not forget that the majority of the human body is
                water.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Quench, you can now cast the entire issue aside and let the app do all the heavy lifting. It accurately calculates and informs you of the exact amount of water you need each
                and every day. If that was not amazing enough, Quench can also track and record how much water you drink each day, as well as monitor how often you accomplish your water drinking goal.
            </p>

            <p>This may seem too good to be true. Good observation; it almost is! Especially when considering Quench&rsquo;s most innovative feature. IT MAKES THE WHOLE PROCESS A BLAST!</p>

            <p>Many people struggle to find the motivation to drink water. They know it's good for them but they prefer better tasting drinks. These are no substitutes, and it is time to stop
                pretending they are. Quench masterfully absolves you from this dilemma by cleverly incentivizing and encouraging users with a compelling reward system.</p>
